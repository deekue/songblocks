<a name="welcome-to-song-blocks" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-song-blocks"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Song Blocks</h3>

<p>I built Song Blocks so my toddler could play music on the living room Sonos by himself without <em>apparently</em> interacting with technology.</p>

<p>I made 12 wood blocks, each containing two magnets and an NFC tag that is mapped to a song.   With a satisfying <em>clack!</em> the blocks magnetically attach to the face of a drawer containing a Raspberry Pi computer and an NFC controller.  The Pi reads the tag, tells the Sonos which song to play, and tweets the song title at <a href="https://twitter.com/songblocks">@songblocks</a>.</p>

<p>The primary design goal was to make the technology disappear completely; the final experience is organic, tactile and aural - and quite magical.  My son loves it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>NFC controller board</li>
<li>NFC tags</li>
<li>Rare-earth magnets</li>
<li>A simple Python script (~100 lines) that I wrote, hosted on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/shawnrk/songblocks">here</a>
</li>
<li>Open-source Python libs: <a href="https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo">SoCo</a> to talk to the Sonos, <a href="https://launchpad.net/nfcpy">nfcpy</a> to talk to the NFC controller, <a href="https://github.com/Mezgrman/TweetPony">TweetPony</a> to talk to Twitter</li>

<p>3/8" thick walnut boards were cut down to pieces measuring 1-1/2"x3-1/4" (two of these form each block).  Cavities were routed out for the NFC tag and magnets (they sit 3/16" below the outer surface).  Magnets were glued in.  The halves were then glued together and clamped.  </p>

<p>Each side was evened out by trimming off a very thin slice with a band saw.  The edges were given a 1/8" radius round-over with a router.  The sides and edges were sanded with 120 grit. Before and after the trimming, radiusing, and sanding:  </p>

<hr><p>The numbers were imprinted with an ink stamp set and then burned in with a soldering iron.  </p>

<p>The wood has been left natural - no oil, sealant, etc.</p>

<a name="the-drawer" class="anchor" href="#the-drawer"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The drawer</h3>

<p>Cavities were routed out from the inside of the drawer face to place the magnets (they sit 3/16" below the outer surface).  The NFC controller board is taped to the inside of the drawer face.  The Raspberry Pi just sits in the drawer, with its power cord running out the back.  The wires between the NFC controller and the Raspberry Pi connect UART Rx, Tx, +5v, and ground.  </p>

<a name="the-code" class="anchor" href="#the-code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The code</h3>

<p>I haven't coded in over a decade and this is my first Python project.  So its ugly, but functional and pretty self-explanatory. The GitHub repo is <a href="https://github.com/shawnrk/songblocks">here</a>.</p>
