songblocks
==========

A python script to remotely control a Sonos music player with NFC tags.  For an overview of the full Song Blocks project, see [here](http://shawnrk.github.io/songblocks).

I'm a mediocre developer at best and this is my first Python project.  I was more interested in getting it working than doing it right, so I absolutely cut some corners.  For instance, part of the nfcpy library is part of this repo because I didn't have the patience to figure out how Python's module path stuff worked, so I just put the module I needed in my working directory.

Thanks to the developers of the SoCo, nfcpy, and TweetPony, libraries. All were pretty easy to use for a novice.
