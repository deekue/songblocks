{"name":"Song Blocks","tagline":"A no-tech, toddler-friendly controller for Sonos using NFC tags","body":"### Welcome to Song Blocks\r\nI built Song Blocks so my toddler could play music on the living room Sonos by himself.  Wood blocks containing NFC tags and magnets mount to a drawer face on a sideboard behind which are matching magnets, an NFC controller and a Raspberry Pi embedded computer.  Each block's NFC tag is mapped to a song which plays when the block attaches, and the song title is tweeted at [@songblocks](https://twitter.com/songblocks).  A primary design goal was to make the technology disappear completely: the experience is purely organic and aural - and quite magical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Technologies Used\r\n* Raspberry Pi Model B+ with a WiFi adapter\r\n* [This](http://www.adafruit.com/product/364) NFC controller\r\n* NFC tags\r\n* Rare-earth magnets\r\n* A simple Python script (~100 lines) I wrote, hosted [here](https://github.com/shawnrk/songblocks)\r\n* Open-source Python libs: [nfcpy](https://launchpad.net/nfcpy) for the NFC interface, [TweetPony](https://github.com/Mezgrman/TweetPony) for the Twitter interface","google":"UA-55524812-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
