{"name":"Song Blocks","tagline":"A no-tech, toddler-friendly controller for Sonos using NFC tags","body":"### Welcome to Song Blocks\r\nI built Song Blocks so my toddler could play music on the living room Sonos by himself.\r\n\r\nWood blocks containing NFC tags magnetically attach to a drawer face, behind which sits a Raspberry Pi and an NFC controller.  Each block's NFC tag is mapped to a song, which plays when the block attaches and stops when it is detached.  Each played song is tweeted at [@songblocks](https://twitter.com/songblocks).  \r\n\r\nThe primary design goal was to make the technology disappear completely: the final experience is organic, tactile and aural - and quite magical.  The blocks align and pull themselves to the drawer face, snapping on with a satisfying _clack!_.  Music fills the room until the block is prised away. [@songblocks](https://twitter.com/songblocks) silently records a history my son's listening habits.  It will be fun to graph it in a few months to see how his preferences have changed over time. \r\n\r\n![Blocks](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ny63nauakkqr4p/blocks.JPG?dl=1)\r\n\r\n### Technologies Used\r\n* Raspberry Pi\r\n* NFC controller board\r\n* NFC tags\r\n* Rare-earth magnets\r\n* A simple Python script (~100 lines) I wrote, hosted [here](https://github.com/shawnrk/songblocks)\r\n* Open-source Python libs: [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo) to talk to the Sonos, [nfcpy](https://launchpad.net/nfcpy) to talk to the NFC controller, [TweetPony](https://github.com/Mezgrman/TweetPony) to talk to Twitter\r\n\r\n### Making the blocks\r\n* I used 3/8\" thick walnut boards and cut them down to pieces that were about 1-1/2\"x3-1/4\".  Two of these form each block.  \r\n* Cavities were routed out for the NFC tag and magnets\r\n* The halves were then glued and clamped\r\n* Each side was cleaned up by sawing off a very thin slice on the band saw\r\n* The edges were given a 1/8\" radius round-over with a router\r\n* The sides and edges were sanded with 120 grit (the seam between the halves were rendered barely visible)\r\n* The numbers were imprinted with a ink stamp set, then burned in with a soldering iron\r\n* I've opted to leave the wood natural - no oil, sealant, etc.\r\n\r\n### The drawer\r\n* Cavities were routed out from the inside of the drawer face to place the magnets\r\n* The NFC controller board is stuck on to the inside of the drawer face with electrical tape\r\n* The Raspberry Pi just sits in the drawer, with its power cord running out the back\r\n\r\n### The code\r\nI haven't coded in over a decade and this is my first Python project.  So its ugly, but functional, and pretty self-explanatory. The repo is [here](https://github.com/shawnrk/songblocks).","google":"UA-55524812-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
