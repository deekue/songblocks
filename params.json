{"name":"Song Blocks","tagline":"A no-tech-high-tech toddler-friendly Sonos controller","body":"### Welcome to Song Blocks\r\nI built Song Blocks so my toddler could play music on the living room Sonos by himself without _apparently_ interacting with technology.\r\n\r\nThe primary design goal was to make the technology disappear completely; the final experience is organic, tactile and aural - and quite magical.  The blocks magnetically align and pull themselves to the drawer face, snapping on with a satisfying _clack!_.  Music fills the room until the block is prised away. [@songblocks](https://twitter.com/songblocks) silently records my son's listening history.  It will be interesting to graph this data to see how his preferences change over time.  \r\n\r\n![Sonos](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2nmt56de2d6rmzk/sonos.JPG?dl=1)  \r\n![drawer](https://www.dropbox.com/s/thajeqv8gg4pt9g/drawer.JPG?dl=1)  \r\n![Blocks](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ny63nauakkqr4p/blocks.JPG?dl=1)  \r\n### Technologies Used\r\n* Raspberry Pi\r\n* NFC controller board\r\n* NFC tags\r\n* Rare-earth magnets\r\n* A simple Python script (~100 lines) that I wrote, hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/shawnrk/songblocks)\r\n* Open-source Python libs: [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo) to talk to the Sonos, [nfcpy](https://launchpad.net/nfcpy) to talk to the NFC controller, [TweetPony](https://github.com/Mezgrman/TweetPony) to talk to Twitter\r\n\r\n### The blocks\r\n3/8\" thick walnut boards were cut down to pieces measuring 1-1/2\"x3-1/4\" (two of these form each block).  Cavities were routed out for the NFC tag and magnets (they sit 3/16\" below the outer surface).  Magnets were glued in.  The halves were then glued together and clamped.  \r\n\r\n![Adding NFC tags and gluing in the magnets](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ivab56cmj4c9a6c/factory.JPG?dl=1)\r\n![Clamping](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ullvmcmbyeu25km/press.JPG?dl=1)  \r\n  \r\nEach side was evened out by trimming off a very thin slice with a band saw.  The edges were given a 1/8\" radius round-over with a router.  The sides and edges were sanded with 120 grit. Before and after the trimming, radiusing, and sanding:  \r\n  \r\n![Before & After](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ufv3jjwsialenos/squareround.JPG?dl=1)\r\n![Before & After 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y5lrcd2twwp79yn/squareround2.JPG?dl=1)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe numbers were imprinted with an ink stamp set and then burned in with a soldering iron.  \r\n\r\n![Burn](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z3jzznzlrof9oyq/burn.JPG?dl=1)  \r\n  \r\nThe wood has been left natural - no oil, sealant, etc.\r\n\r\n### The drawer\r\nCavities were routed out from the inside of the drawer face to place the magnets (they sit 3/16\" below the outer surface).  The NFC controller board is taped to the inside of the drawer face.  The Raspberry Pi just sits in the drawer, with its power cord running out the back.  The wires between the NFC controller and the Raspberry Pi connect UART Rx, Tx, +5v, and ground.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### The code\r\nI haven't coded in over a decade and this is my first Python project.  So its ugly, but functional and pretty self-explanatory. The GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/shawnrk/songblocks).","google":"UA-55524812-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
