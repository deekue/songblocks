{"name":"Song Blocks","tagline":"A no-tech, toddler-friendly controller for Sonos using NFC tags","body":"### Welcome to Song Blocks\r\nI built Song Blocks so my toddler could play music on the living room Sonos by himself.\r\n\r\nWood blocks containing NFC tags magnetically attach to a drawer face, behind which sits a Raspberry Pi and an NFC controller.  Each block's NFC tag is mapped to a song, which plays when the block attaches and stops when it is detached.  The title of each played song is tweeted at [@songblocks (https://twitter.com/songblocks).  \r\n\r\nThe primary design goal was to make the technology disappear completely: the final experience is organic, tactile and aural - and quite magical.  The blocks align and pull themselves to the drawer face, snapping on with a satisfying _clack!_.  Music fills the room until the block is prised away. The [@songblocks](https://twitter.com/songblocks) Twitter feed silently records a history my son's listening habits.  It will be fun to graph it in a few months to see how his preferences have changed over time. \r\n\r\n![Blocks](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ny63nauakkqr4p/blocks.JPG?dl=1)\r\n\r\n### Technologies Used\r\n* Raspberry Pi\r\n* NFC controller board\r\n* NFC tags\r\n* Rare-earth magnets\r\n* A simple Python script (~100 lines) I wrote, hosted [here](https://github.com/shawnrk/songblocks)\r\n* Open-source Python libs: [nfcpy](https://launchpad.net/nfcpy) for the NFC interface, [TweetPony](https://github.com/Mezgrman/TweetPony) for the Twitter interface\r\n\r\n### Making the blocks\r\nI used 3/8\" thick walnut boards and cut them down to pieces that were about 1-1/2\"x3-1/4\".  \r\nCavities were routed out for the NFC tag and magnets\r\nThe halves were then glued and clamped\r\nEach side was cleaned up with a band saw, taking just a thin slice off each side to even things up\r\nThe edges were rounded off with a router\r\nThe sides and edges were sanded (the seam between the halves is barely visible)\r\nThe numbers were burned in\r\nI've opted to leave the wood natural - no oil, sealant, etc.\r\n\r\n### The drawer\r\nCavities were routed out from the inside of the drawer face to place the magnets\r\nThe NFC controller board is stuck on to the inside of the drawer face with electrical tape\r\nThe Raspberry Pi just sits in the drawer, with its power cord running out the back\r\n\r\n### The code\r\nI haven't coded in over a decade and this is my first Python project.  So its ugly, but functional, and pretty self-explanatory. The repo is [here](https://github.com/shawnrk/songblocks).","google":"UA-55524812-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
