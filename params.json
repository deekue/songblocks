{"name":"Song Blocks","tagline":"A no-tech-high-tech toddler-friendly Sonos controller","body":"### Welcome to Song Blocks\r\nI built Song Blocks so my toddler could play music on the living room Sonos by himself without _apparently_ interacting with technology.\r\n\r\nWood blocks containing NFC tags magnetically attach to a drawer face, behind which sits a Raspberry Pi and an NFC controller.  Each block's NFC tag is mapped to a song, which plays on the Sonos when the block attaches to the drawer and stops when it is detached.  Each played song is tweeted at [@songblocks](https://twitter.com/songblocks).  \r\n\r\n\r\n![Sonos](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2nmt56de2d6rmzk/sonos.JPG?dl=1)  \r\n![drawer](https://www.dropbox.com/s/thajeqv8gg4pt9g/drawer.JPG?dl=1)  \r\nThe primary design goal was to make the technology disappear completely; the final experience is organic, tactile and aural - and quite magical.  The blocks align and pull themselves to the drawer face, snapping on with a satisfying _clack!_.  Music fills the room until the block is prised away. [@songblocks](https://twitter.com/songblocks) silently records my son's listening history.  It will be interesting to graph this data to see how his preferences change over time. \r\n\r\n![Blocks](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ny63nauakkqr4p/blocks.JPG?dl=1)  \r\n### Technologies Used\r\n* Raspberry Pi\r\n* NFC controller board\r\n* NFC tags\r\n* Rare-earth magnets\r\n* A simple Python script (~100 lines) that I wrote, hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/shawnrk/songblocks)\r\n* Open-source Python libs: [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo) to talk to the Sonos, [nfcpy](https://launchpad.net/nfcpy) to talk to the NFC controller, [TweetPony](https://github.com/Mezgrman/TweetPony) to talk to Twitter\r\n\r\n### The blocks\r\n* 3/8\" thick walnut boards were cut down to pieces measuring 1-1/2\"x3-1/4\" (two of these form each block)  \r\n* Cavities were routed out for the NFC tag and magnets (they sit 3/16\" below the outer surface).  Magnets were glued in.\r\n![Adding NFC tags and gluing in the magnets](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ivab56cmj4c9a6c/factory.JPG?dl=1)\r\n* The halves were then glued and clamped\r\n![Clamping](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ullvmcmbyeu25km/press.JPG?dl=1)\r\n* Each side was evened out by trimming off a very thin slice with a band saw\r\n* The edges were given a 1/8\" radius round-over with a router\r\n* The sides and edges were sanded with 120 grit. Before and after the trimming, radiusing, and sanding:\r\n![Before & After](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ufv3jjwsialenos/squareround.JPG?dl=1)\r\n![Before & After 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y5lrcd2twwp79yn/squareround2.JPG?dl=1)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n* The numbers were imprinted with an ink stamp set and then burned in with a soldering iron\r\n![Burn](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z3jzznzlrof9oyq/burn.JPG?dl=1)\r\n* The wood has been left natural - no oil, sealant, etc.\r\n\r\n### The drawer\r\n* Cavities were routed out from the inside of the drawer face to place the magnets (they sit 3/16\" below the outer surface)\r\n* The NFC controller board is taped to the inside of the drawer face\r\n* The Raspberry Pi just sits in the drawer, with its power cord running out the back\r\n* The wires between the NFC controller and the Raspberry Pi connect UART Rx, Tx, +5v, and ground \r\n\r\n### The code\r\nI haven't coded in over a decade and this is my first Python project.  So its ugly, but functional and pretty self-explanatory. The GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/shawnrk/songblocks).","google":"UA-55524812-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
