{"name":"Song Blocks","tagline":"A no-tech-high-tech toddler-friendly Sonos controller","body":"### Welcome to Song Blocks\r\nI built Song Blocks so my toddler could play music on the living room Sonos without _apparently_ interacting with technology.\r\n\r\nI made 12 wood blocks, each containing two magnets and an NFC tag that is mapped to a song.   With a satisfying _clack!_ the blocks magnetically attach to the face of a drawer containing a Raspberry Pi computer and an NFC controller.  The Pi reads the tag, tells the Sonos which song to play, and tweets the song title at [@songblocks](https://twitter.com/songblocks).\r\n\r\nThe primary design goal was to make the technology disappear completely; the final experience is organic, tactile and aural - and quite magical.  My son loves it.\r\n\r\n![Sonos](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2nmt56de2d6rmzk/sonos.JPG?dl=1)  \r\n![drawer](https://www.dropbox.com/s/thajeqv8gg4pt9g/drawer.JPG?dl=1)  \r\n\r\n### Technologies Used\r\n* Raspberry Pi\r\n* NFC controller board\r\n* NFC tags\r\n* Rare-earth magnets\r\n* A simple Python script (~100 lines) that I wrote, hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/shawnrk/songblocks)\r\n* Open-source Python libs: [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo) to talk to the Sonos, [nfcpy](https://launchpad.net/nfcpy) to talk to the NFC controller, [TweetPony](https://github.com/Mezgrman/TweetPony) to talk to Twitter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### The drawer\r\nCavities were routed out from the inside of the drawer face to place the magnets (they sit 3/16\" below the outer surface).  The NFC controller board is taped to the inside of the drawer face.  The Raspberry Pi just sits in the drawer, with its power cord running out the back.  The four wires between the NFC controller and the Raspberry Pi connect UART Rx, Tx, +5v, and ground.  \r\n\r\n![inside](https://www.dropbox.com/s/thsis3mgbukt754/inside.jpg?dl=1)  \r\n\r\n\r\n### The blocks\r\n3/8\" thick walnut boards were cut down to pieces measuring 1-1/2\"x3-1/4\" (two of these form each block).  Cavities were routed out for the NFC tag and magnets (they sit 3/16\" below the outer surface).  Magnets were glued in.  The halves were then glued together and clamped.  \r\n\r\n![Adding NFC tags and gluing in the magnets](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ivab56cmj4c9a6c/factory.JPG?dl=1)\r\n![Clamping](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ullvmcmbyeu25km/press.JPG?dl=1)  \r\n  \r\n***\r\n\r\nEach side was evened out by trimming off a very thin slice with a band saw.  The edges were given a 1/8\" radius round-over with a router.  The sides and edges were sanded with 150 grit sandpaper. The seam between the halves was rendered nearly indiscernible.  \r\nBefore and after the trimming, radiusing, and sanding:  \r\n  \r\n![Before & After](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ufv3jjwsialenos/squareround.JPG?dl=1)\r\n![Before & After 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y5lrcd2twwp79yn/squareround2.JPG?dl=1)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe numbers were imprinted with an ink stamp set and then burned in with a soldering iron.  \r\n\r\n![Burn](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z3jzznzlrof9oyq/burn.JPG?dl=1)  \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe wood has been left natural - no oil or stain.  Naked walnut is beautiful, wears well, and smells nice.  \r\n\r\n![Blocks](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ny63nauakkqr4p/blocks.JPG?dl=1)  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### The code\r\nI haven't coded in over a decade and this is my first Python project.  So its ugly, but functional and pretty self-explanatory. The GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/shawnrk/songblocks).","google":"UA-55524812-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
